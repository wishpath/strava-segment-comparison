to_do:
    - add details in readme:
    - detalize all the variables needed for running the app
    - improve presentation of an application (screenshots, descriptions);

ideas:
  - get all people best time through API not from DOM
  - wrong KOM logic:
      - when in Strava your selected gender is NOT "prefer not to say":
          - public boolean amKingOfMountain(SegmentDTO s) {
          - @JsonProperty("is_kom") public boolean isKingOfMountain; //does not mean necessarily, is absolute best. Means best for gender (men or women). Someone who does not pick gender, does not steal KOM from men or women.
