to_do:
  - put storage files to storage
  - if i've got KOM, what should i do with 0/0 efforts in the label?
  - fix printing to console.
  - put functionalities back to stream peek elements
  - with stream only get raw segments and filter. do modifications separately
  - score for very long segments should be fixed:
      - 100 should be amazing score
      - but for example of "Chocholow granica - Magura" (8667m):
          - gets score of 708 - does not make much sense
  - add details in readme:
      - detalize all the variables needed for running the app
      - improve presentation of an application (screenshots, descriptions);
  - make a "data" package (or named like "memory") for storing pre-saved polylines and "all people best times"
  - add more info to the label:
      - next to "my best pace" -> "all people best pace"
      - next to "my best time" -> "all people best time"
ideas:
  - detail
  - get all people best time through API not from DOM
